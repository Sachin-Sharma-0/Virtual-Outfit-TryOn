# Virtual-Outfit-TryOn

The Virtual Outfit Try-On Project is an application that allows users to try on outfits virtually by uploading their own photos and an outfit image. The app utilizes artificial intelligence techniques to segment the user's image, estimate the pose, and warp the outfit onto the user's body, providing a visual representation of how the outfit would look when worn.

## Features

- Upload multiple user images and an outfit image.
- Automatic image segmentation to isolate the user's body from the background.
- Pose estimation to determine the user's body position and orientation.
- Warping of the outfit image to match the user's body pose and position.
- Display the result image with the outfit applied to the user's uploaded images.
- Intuitive and user-friendly web interface.

   ```shell

Steps to use:

Click the "Upload" button to process the images and generate the result. The result will be displayed below in the "Result" section, showing the user's uploaded images with the outfit applied.
